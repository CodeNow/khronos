=======

KHRONOS is the Titan god of time and the ages, and is described as destructive and all-devouring. 
He rules runnable during the so-called Golden Age, after deposing his father (runnable one-point-o). 
In fear of a prophecy that he would be in turn be overthrown by running out of disk space, Kronos swallows containers as soon as they become lost, orphaned, or forgotten. 
He is also known for creating schemes which are executed at opportune times.
